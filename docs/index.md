Welcome to the Korea University Particle Physics DREAM (Design, Realize, Experiment, Analysis, Measurement) Group.
The group **probes fundamental questions in particle physics with experiments**. 

## CMS experiment
Our group is investigating particle physics with the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment.

**Particle physics questions** that are being probed.

- Why is the **Higgs boson** mass (125 GeV) light compared to it's high energy corrections ($10^{19}$ GeV)?
- What is the physics of **dark matter**? 
- Are there unknown particles that couple with the Higgs boson?
- What is the shape of the Higgs potential that determines the fate of the universe?
- What is the source of the **matter anti-matter asymmetry** observed in the universe?

**Technical** explaination of the experiement, where one can develop and get experience on these technologies.

1. Particles are created by **accelerating protons** to collide with each other at **high energies (13-14 TeV)**.
1. These particles pass through **silicon, scintillator, and gas detectors** which create electric pulses.
1. The detector electric pulses are digitized through **ASIC chips and electronic boards**.
1. Quick (0.000004 second) **firmware (FPGA) triggers** are used to select the digitized detector data to store.
1. Data is stored through **high speed (4 Tb/s) Data Acquisition (DAQ)** using **optical transceivers**.
1. The **Big Data (100 Petabyte)** is processed with **cloud of (10,000) servers** around the globe.
1. Measurements are made by **analyzing data with software**, where **statistical methods** and **machine learning** techniques such as **artificial intelligence** are used.
1. **Monitoring software** is used to **continuously check** the status of the detector and servers.
