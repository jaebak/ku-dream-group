### Search for a Higgs boson decaying to a Z boson and a Photon. 

The Standard Model of particle physics predicts that a Higgs boson can decay 
to a Z boson and a photon at the Large Hadron Collider. 
This decay could also be largely effected by undiscovered particles 
making it an important probe for Beyond the Standard Model physics. 
However the decay has not been observed yet at the Large Hadron Collider 
because the expected quantity is small and the Drell-Yan background is large, 
which makes the data analysis challenging. 
Our group is developing methods to improve the sensitivity and reliability of the data analysis.

### Search for Higgsino (Supersymmetry particle) with Higgs bosons. 

The supersymmetry theory adds an additional symmetry to the Standard Model, 
which makes it possible to explain the reason the Higgs mass being light. 
The theory also has particles that could describe Dark Matter. 
However supersymmetric particles have not been observed at the Large Hadron Collider. 
This could mean that supersymmetry paticles are being produced at a small rate, 
making Higgsinos interesting because these particles are 
predicted to be produced at a small rate. 
Our group is searching for Higgsinos that have Higgs bosons in their decay.

### Improving data analysis performance with machine learning techniques such as artificial intelligence. 

Experimental particle physics has a long history in using 
machine learning techniques for analyzing data. 
The recent artificial intelligence developments 
in the natural language field are giving impacts to experimental particle physics,
where recent neural network structures are being adapted and applied.
Our group is developing recent machine learning techniques 
to improve the performance of data analyses.
